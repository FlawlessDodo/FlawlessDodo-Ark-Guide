  <p>
    The Thylacoleo, one of my personal favorites, is a carnivore with the unique ability to scale straight vertical surfaces.
    However, unlike the other creature able to scale surfaces, it isn't absolutely worthless in a fight. In fact, it has almost the <thead>
      exact stats of a Spino!
      <br />
      It is widely considered one of the best caving creatures you can get, being mobile, small, and strong all at the same time!
      It also takes almost no fall damage, and has high agility, which makes quick getaways even quicker.
