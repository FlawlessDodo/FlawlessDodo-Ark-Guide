      Oh man, where do I get started with this guy, the Sarco, in my opinion, one of the best creatures in the game.
      A Sarco will most likely be your first decent water creature on your journey, at least in the fighting aspect,
      or maybe even the first decent tame in general!
      <br />
      With stats comparable to a Carno, this thing is nothing to laugh at in combat, whether land or sea. It can lunge, deathroll,
      and turn around instantly if you attack facing backwards, so it is very mobile with attacks. It has good stat levelling scale,
      so it doesn't actually get outclassed that much.
