    <p>
      The Giga is one of the strongest dinos in the game with some of the highest base stats in the game, both wild or tamed, despite being much weaker after
      being tamed. It is one of the best hunting dinos in the game because of its strength and even speed. Do note the only thing worth leveling up in a giga
      is melee damage, as it gains miniscule stat boosts, but having such high base melee makes leveling that stat more worth it. It should also be noted
      that the stamina drain is absurd on a giga, so don't bother sprinting, besides, it is already one of the fastest dinos even while walking because of its size.
